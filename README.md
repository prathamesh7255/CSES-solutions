# CSES-solutions
Hello everyone, 
In this repo I have added the solutions to the [CSES problemset](https://cses.fi/problemset/).
I will be adding the solutions as I solve the problems, so all the solutions are not added yet.
In several solutions, although the code is correct I want to optimize it.
If any bright minds want to guide me by making solutions more optimized, I would be pleased.
Thank you.
